I am a **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)** with a strong focus on infrastructure, platforms, Linux, open-source software, DevOps practices, distributed computing, (Kubernetes) containerization, and cloud technologies.

Throughout my career, I've worked with a variety of languages and platforms, though my current focus is on Python, Go, and shell scripting.

Outside of the tech world, I enjoy swimming, reading and city biking. If you have questions about any of these topics or just want to chat, feel free to reach out!
